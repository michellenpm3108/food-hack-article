                <p>Making healthy food choices is much easier if you take some time to plan ahead. To know what groceries you need for your meals, and what snacks are the quickest and tastiest for snack-attacks.</p>
                <p>Below are 4 hacks and tips that I use to help me make the most nourishing choices, but just use whichever tricks you think would help you the most. </p>

                        <h2>1. You eat what you see</h2>
                        <p>When it comes to food, that saying "out of sight, out of mind", is rather true when it comes to food as well. If you want to eat more fruit, keeping them on the counter in clear view might help. Instead of tossing an orange or apple in you bag, take some time to peel or cut it, put it in a container, and leave in on your desk to enjoy when you're hungry.  </p>
                    </div>

                        <p> Having them ready to go and in plain view also makes it more likely that your partner or children will eat it. Swap out your usual snacks, like chips or crackers, for a more nutrient dense one, like nuts or seeds. </p>

                    <div class="col-2">
                        <h2>2. Fresher for longer</h2>
                        <p>To go with tip #1, we're more likely to snack on vegetables, like carrots and celery, if they're already chopped up and waiting for us in the fridge. </p>
                        <p>But have you ever noticed that sometimes your prepped veggies lose their crunch, dry up, or develop a slimy film? </p>    
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <img class="icon" src="tips.png" alt="lamp icon">
                        <p>There is a quick and easy way to avoid that! </p>  
                        <p>Just store them in a glass container with water. It helps to keep them crispy and fresh, and they keep for a longer time. Just don't forget to change out the water every few days.</p>

                        <h2>3. A Need for the Seed</h2>
                        <p>Nut butters are already pretty nutrient dense, but there is a way to pack them with even more good stuff. </p>
                        <p>Take a partial jar of nut butter, and add a mix of seeds, such as toasted sesame seeds, chia seeds, roughly ground flax seeds, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, and pumpkin seeds.  </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <img class="icon" src="tips.png" alt="lamp icon">
                        <p> Mix it all up, and store in the fridge. It's delicious on toast, mixed into oatmeal, or stuffed into dates as a snack. </p>

                    <div class="col-2">
                        <h2>4. Spice up your life</h2>
                        <p>Second berries, herbs and spices are the most antioxidant rich foods. Make healthy food even more wholesome by spicing them up! </p>
                        <p>Spices also add a flavour burst that can help you to reduce the amount of oil, salt, and sugar you use in a recipe!</p>

                    <div class="col">

                        <p> A bowl of whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce and broccoli, for example, has 150 units of antioxidants... but if we add 1 tsp (5 g) of dried oregano to that, the number doubles to 300 units </p>
